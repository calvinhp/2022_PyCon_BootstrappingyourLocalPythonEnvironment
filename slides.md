The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

::: notes

April 2018 Randall Munroe posted this comic and admitted he did some bad things to get to this point.

The Python environmental protection agency wants to seal it in a cement chamber, with pictorial messages to future civilizations warning them about the danger of using `sudo` to install random Python packages.

# Python lives in many places {data-background-image="images/5450163349_7d5d45befb_o.jpg"}

* Python provided by OS (macOS, RedHat, Ubuntu)
* Python installed from an App Store (Microsoft Store)
* Python installed from [python.org](https://python.org) installer
* Python installed from a Package Manager (apt, [brew](https://brew.sh), [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/))
* Python installed by a Python Distribution ([ActiveState](https://www.activestate.com/products/python/), [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual))

# Some Rules {.r-fit-text}

# ðŸš¯ No `sudo` {.r-fit-text}
## I don't care, no whining {.fragment}

# ðŸ“µ Do not use the system Python {.r-fit-text}

## For Anything {.fragment}

# ðŸ¤” Ok Smart Guy

# pyenv

* Change the global Python version on a per-user basis
* Per-project Python versions
* Override the Python version with an environment variable
* Search commands from multiple versions of Python at a time
  
<https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation>  

<https://pyenv-win.github.io/pyenv-win/>

:::notes
This may be helpful to test across Python versions with tox.

Pyenv does not work in Windows outside the Windows Subsystem for Linux.
:::

# Let's see `pyenv` in action ðŸš€

> Explicit is better than implicit.

:::notes
Show global and local
Install a python version
View installed versions
:::

# `pyenv` Plugins

* virtualenv
* virtualenvwrapper

~~~{.bash}
$ brew search pyenv
~~~

# `virtualenv` & `virtualenvwrapper`

:::notes
pyenv virtualenvs

show global freeze, make a virtualenv, show freeze, install  requests

quick demo of virtualenvwrapper
:::

# Virtual Environments are Included ðŸ”‹ {.r-fit-text}

## If you have simple needs, this is for you!

~~~{.bash}
$ python -m venv venv
~~~

:::notes
make sure to show that you can explicitly control which python version via the path to python
show interacting with pyenv to set a specific python for the project and creating an env
:::

# pipx

<https://pypa.github.io/pipx/>

~~~{.bash}
$ brew install pipx
$ pipx ensurepath

pipx is ready to go! âœ¨ ðŸŒŸ âœ¨
~~~


## Let's do some damage {.fragment}

~~~{.bash .fragment}
$ pipx install httpie
  installed package httpie 2.4.0, Python 3.9.6
  These apps are now globally available
    - http
    - https
done! âœ¨ ðŸŒŸ âœ¨
~~~

:::notes
show installing bpytop
show installing markdown and injecting pygments
:::


# What about the "user scheme"?

    $ python -m pip install --user SomePackage

:::notes
runs into the same problems as using the global python
also, the uninstall does not support --user
::: 

# But what about ...

* [Anaconda Python and Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
* [ActiveState Python](https://www.activestate.com/products/python/)
* [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
* [asdf](https://github.com/danhper/asdf-python)
* [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
* [PDM](https://pypi.org/project/pdm/)
* [pyproject.toml](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/)

:::notes
`pipenv` seemed promising in the beginning...
`asdf` if closest to pyenv, but lacks nice plugins like virtualenv

show `poetry` demo if time
:::

# But I want repeatability and simplicity...

> Simple is better than complex.

* [piptools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/#readme)

:::notes
demo

Create demo foler and venv

Install requests

Freeze to reqs.txt

Add reqs.in

python -m piptools compile --upgrade --no-annotate --no-header --allow-unsafe --generate-hashes --output-file /local/requirements1.txt /local/requirements1.in
:::

# I mean really repeatable...

## Enter Docker + `pip-tools`
